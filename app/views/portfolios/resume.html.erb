            Hey I am <span class="me">Partho Ghosh</span>. I am a Software Engineer who spent about <span class="me">10 years</span> in building production ready software in web (mostly) and mobile domain. I mostly write code in <span class="me">Ruby</span> and <span class="me">Java</span>. My day to day goal is to get continuously better in overall aspects of software engineering like front-end, backend, architecture, scale, alogirhtms, etc. I started my engineering journey with the hopes to become a game developer (and I kind of acheived it when I got hired in Gameloft as game programmer) but then slowly drifted into web/mobile domain. My secret desire is to get back into it one day.
